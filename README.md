📌 CodeAlpha – Task 2
🚀 CI Pipeline using Jenkins (Flask Application)
📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins.

The pipeline automatically pulls code from GitHub and executes build stages defined in a Jenkinsfile.

This task was completed as part of the CodeAlpha DevOps Internship – Task 2.

🎯 Objective

To automate the build process using Jenkins and integrate it with a GitHub repository.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Flask

Git & GitHub

Jenkins

Windows Environment

🔁 CI Workflow

1️⃣ Code pushed to GitHub
2️⃣ Jenkins fetches repository
3️⃣ Jenkins reads the Jenkinsfile
4️⃣ Dependencies installed automatically
5️⃣ Pipeline executes stages
6️⃣ Build marked as SUCCESS
